**timer.py** is a simple Python script allowing users to set timer duration. Upon timer expiry, the user will see the time-up meme.
- timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **pillow library** to facilitate the meme display.
**Pseudocode** is a document that allows us to see the logic and flow of our code before we begin programming.


  
Please see the documentation for the library used:
